Introduction of Blockchain â€“ Based Voting System
	A blockchain-based voting system takes advantage of blockchain technology's decentralization, transparency, and immutability to build a secure and auditable voting process. Votes are recorded on a distributed ledger rather than centralized servers or actual voting boxes, making tampering or manipulating the results extremely difficult.
 
Describe the Blockchain-Based Voting System 
          SHA-256 and other cryptographic hash functions are used to hash and encrypt each vote. As a result, the vote is represented by a distinct, fixed-size hash value. A chain of votes is then created by storing the hash on the blockchain and connecting it to the prior vote. Any effort to change a vote's hash would break the chain and make the manipulation instantly apparent.

Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?
          Blockchain based voting system using hashing have potential the way we vote and have numerous benefits , namely:  it secure elections , enhanced transparency , improved accessibility and reduce costs. It contributes to all individuals, societies and communities in strengthening democracy , fostering trust, improving governance and increasing voter participation.
